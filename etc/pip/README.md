## requirements.txt vs constraints.txt

This folder contains a number of USE-requirements.txt files and a single constraints.txt.

Each requirements.txt file includes and only includes a set of .req files from the ./components
folder. These requirements.txt files should always install the required pypa projects for their
given uses. For instance, most users only need to `pip install -r dev-requirements.txt`.

The constraints.txt file is generated by running ../buildscripts/pip-test.sh with all
of the .req files in ./components except for platform.req (which it automatically appends to its
output file). This file represents a _somewhat_ portable manifest of the latest acceptable pypa
project according to your python installs. It is used to install the site-packages in the
toolchain-builder. It can also be used to verify your toolchain or constrain your local python
environment.
